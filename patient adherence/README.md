# ðŸ“ˆ Patient Adherence Analysis Notebook

This folder contains a Jupyter notebook (`patient_adherence.ipynb`) dedicated to analyzing patient adherence data for infusion treatments.

## Notebook Overview
- **Data Import & Preprocessing:**
  - Data generated using the code in TBD. Data generated relies on code implemented in datautils library following the procedure outlined in Data Source.
  - Loads and cleans raw patient treatment data, handling missing or corrupt entries.
  - Converts relevant columns to appropriate data types for analysis.
- **Adherence Metrics Calculation:**
  - Computes key adherence metrics, such as missed doses, treatment completion rates, and timing adherence.
  - Segments analysis by patient, treatment type, or other relevant categories.
- **Visualization:**
  - Generates visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line plots) to illustrate adherence trends and patterns across the patient population.
- **Comparative Analysis:**
  - Compares adherence rates across different cohorts, time periods, or treatment protocols as available in the data.
- **Summary & Insights:**
  - Provides summary tables and key findings to support clinical or operational decision-making.

## Data Source
- The raw data for this analysis is sourced from internal databases or exports, as specified within the notebook.
- Data privacy and security are maintained throughout the analysis process.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional adherence metrics as new data fields become available.
- Enhance cohort segmentation and statistical analysis.
- Add mapping of adherence events to clinical outcomes if data permits.
