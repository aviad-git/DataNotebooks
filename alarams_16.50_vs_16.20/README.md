# ðŸ“Š Alarm Analysis: Software Versions 16.20 vs 16.50

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for analyzing and comparing alarm data generated by infusion pumps running software versions 16.20 and 16.50.

## Notebook Contents
- **Data Import & Preprocessing:**
  - Imports raw treatment data for EU and US regions, generated using a query to the Insights database.
  - Cleans and preprocesses the data, including datetime conversion and removal of corrupt or incomplete rows.
- **Software Version Assignment:**
  - Assigns software version to each treatment based on the `current_software_version` and `last_software_update` fields.
  - Only treatments with a clear version assignment (after the last software update) are included in the main analysis.
- **Alarm Extraction & Transformation:**
  - Extracts unique alarm codes from comma-delimited strings in the `alarm_codes` column.
  - Constructs a DataFrame with counts of each alarm per treatment and associates each with its software version.
- **Visualization & Analysis:**
  - Generates pie charts showing the distribution of alarm counts for each software version.
  - Produces bar plots comparing the probability of each alarm code between versions.
  - Calculates and visualizes cumulative counts and percentages of treatments and unique pumps by software version over time.
  - Provides summary tables with absolute and relative alarm frequencies.

## Data Source
- The raw data was generated using a query to the Insights database.
- Future improvements to this notebook are planned, including increased utilization of raw data once the software version tracking table becomes available. This will allow for more accurate and comprehensive assignment of software versions to treatments and pumps.

## Next Steps
- Map alarm codes to human-readable descriptions for improved interpretability.
- Incorporate additional data fields as they become available.
- Enhance analysis and visualizations as the software version tracking infrastructure is improved.
